# Git-commands and Kubernetes app
In this repository, I'll be practicing git commands and following its strategies in order to have a better knowledge of its use. Besides, I'll be using Kubernetes for creating some resources, which are: Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress, Secrets, and CofigMap, and including backend, frontend, and database apps.

Lets start by using Git

Some commands used in Git and then Kubernetes:
1. show
2. add
3. status 
4. push
5. pull 


# kubernetes

Commands used more frequently in kubernetes.
1. apply -f + manifest.yaml
2. delete f 
3. get pods
4. get svc
5. get deployments 

This image below depicts my architecture as created via kubernetes.
